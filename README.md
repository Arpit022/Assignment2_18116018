# SimpleRISC Assembly Program

This repository contains a SimpleRISC assembly program written as part of a computer architecture or microprocessor coursework.

## 📌 Overview

The program demonstrates:

- Use of registers and arithmetic instructions (`add`, `mul`, `cmp`)
- Nested loop structures (`.Loop1`, `.loop2`, `.loop3`)
- Conditional branching with labels (`beq`, `bgt`, `h`)
- Computation of powers (e.g., square, cube) using multiplication
- Basic control flow in SimpleRISC assembly

## 📝 Program Structure

- **Outer loop (.Loop1):** Controls the main iterations.
- **Inner loops:** Perform computations of powers and compare with target values.
- **Branching:** Conditional jumps to labels based on comparison results.

## ⚙ Sample functionality (inferred)

Although the exact objective of the program is not documented, based on analysis:
- It likely calculates powers (squares, cubes) and compares them to values in registers.
- It demonstrates nested loop control and conditional branching in assembly.

## 🚀 How to run

1. Use a SimpleRISC simulator (e.g., provided in academic labs or open-source SimpleRISC emulators).
2. Load the assembly code from this repository.
3. Step through the code or run to completion to observe register values and branching behavior.

## 🔑 Notes

- This code is kept here as an example of low-level programming practice.
- No warranty on correctness — it was an academic exercise.
- Feel free to fork or build upon this if you're exploring assembly programming!
